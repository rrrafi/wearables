Below are the column names / variables of the output DataFrame created by the run_analysis.R script.
"Actvity" indicates the activity performed by the subject -- laying, sitting, walking, walking downstairs, walking upstairs, walking standing, or laying.
"SubjectID" is the ID of the test subject
All other columns represent the means of the variable, for the specified activity, for the specifid subject.
For futher explanations regarding the variables itself, please refer to the explanations given in the source UCI HAR dataset itself.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
