The script run_analysis.R performs the following steps, each of which is commented in the code itself:
- Loads training & test sets and combines them via rbind
- Feature (variable) names are added as column names
- The activity (ys from training/test) is added as another column
- The subject ID is added as another column
- A new dataframe is created that maintains only variable mean & std deviation columns (and activity and ID columns)
- A further summary dataframe is created showing the average value per variable, per activity, per subject
- The summary dataframe is saved as "wearables.txt" in the current working directory





This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
